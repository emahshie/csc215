# Preface
- Assembly language is compact and fast
- Assembly language forces the programmer to think like the machine
- Each computer has different operating procedures
- CP/M has simplified assembly language by making programs portable
- Three main aspects of assembly programing with CP/M:
  1. Understanding of the facilities and operation of CP/M and its utility programs
  2. Understanding of the internal organization and instruction set of the 8080 family of microprocessors
  3. Understanding of the proper design of assembly language programs
- The book concurrently teaches readers how to edit, assemble, and debug programs, and how to interface those programs to the operating system

# Introduction
- For listed code, keystrokes are in bold and characters displayed by CP/M are not
- Mnemonics make assembly language source code easier to read
- Using the editor and assembler is the most error-free way to create a program
- Assembly language is used for intimate interfacing with hardware
- Required equipment:
  - This book
  - A CP/M based computer
  - The manual set that accompanied the CP/M operating system
  - One complete copy of the CP/M system disk
  - One fresh, clean, empty disk (dedicated to exercises and experiments)
  - A copy of the "8080/8085 Assembly Language Programming Manual," publication number 98-940 (available from Intel Corporation, Literature Department, 3065 Bowers Avenue, Santa Clara, CA 95051, for $17)

- Using CP/M's Dynamic Debugging Tool (DDT), we entered and ran a machine language program that displayed the "$" character on the console before returning control to the CP/M operating system
