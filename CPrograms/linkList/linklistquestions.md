# Link List Questions
1. The structure for each node needs to contain a variable to hold the data and a pointer to the next node.

2. The head would be a node.

3. Arrays store elements in contiguous memory locations, which allows for access using its index, while link lists store elements in separate nodes that are scattered throughout memory, and you need to access the previous node to reach the next node. Arrays are better for faster, random access, but link lists are better for frequent insertions or deletions.

4. 

    printList - print out the link list
    
    newNode - make a new node
    
    insert - insert a node
